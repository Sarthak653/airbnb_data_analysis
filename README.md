# airbnb_data_analysis
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on Airbnb listings to uncover insights on pricing, room types, host behavior, and neighborhood trends.
This project explores Airbnb listing data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand trends in pricing, room types, neighborhoods, and host performance. It answers questions like:

What are the most common room types?

Which neighborhoods have the most listings?

How does price vary by room type and location?

Do top hosts get better reviews?

The goal is to practice data cleaning, visualization, and analysis skills while gaining insights from real-world data.
